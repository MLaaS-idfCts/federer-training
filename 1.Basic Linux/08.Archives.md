### Goals
- The trainee will understand how to work with archives in Linux.
- The trainee will understand the difference between the compression formats.

### Tasks
- Regular tar archive format:
  - Create tar archive for your home directory.
  - Now list the contents of the archive you've created.
  - Add the contents of the /tmp directory to the existing tar archive.
  - Now extract one file which was in /tmp to your home directory.
  - Extract the whole archive in /tmp directory.
- Repeat the previous exercises but now for tar.gz and tar.bz2 formats. 
- Which one is faster? Compress the whole /etc directory and compare the uncompression for the 2 formats with time command.
- Can I use gzip to create an archive of a directory? 
- Can I use gzip -d in order to decompress a zip archive? If not, in which way I can?
- Name the main differences between zip and gzip in terms of capabilities and compression/decompression.
